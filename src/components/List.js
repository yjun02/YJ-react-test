                    <p>
                        Teemo was originally designed as a support champion but became an assassin due to a coding bug
                        that made his darts overly powerful. Riot decided to keep it.

                    <p>
                        Ahri's charm was originally called "Lullaby Kiss," and it dealt no damage but put enemies to
                        sleep for 10 seconds. This was deemed "too unfair," leading to its current form.

                    <p>
                        Yasuo's ultimate, "Last Breath," was once tested with no cooldown. This resulted in a 100%
                        pick/ban rate in the test servers and immediate rollback of the feature.

                    <p>
                        Lux's ultimate, "Final Spark," was a placeholder name during development. The original idea was
                        to call it "Rainbow Laser," but it was scrapped for being too playful.

                    <p>
                        Garen's spin ability ("Judgment") was inspired by the animation of a pizza chef tossing dough in
                        the air.
